  "actionsSummary": "The TypeScript compilation failed due to missing dependencies. The main issues are:\n1. React and its type definitions are not found.\n2. Testing library dependencies are missing.\n3. Some implicit 'any' types need to be addressed.\n\nTo resolve these issues:\n1. Run 'yarn install' to install the dependencies specified in package.json.\n2. After installation, run 'tsc' again to check if the compilation errors are resolved.\n3. If there are still 'implicit any' errors, we may need to update the code to provide explicit types.\n\nOnce these steps are completed, we should run the tests to ensure the todo list functionality works as expected."
