  "actionsSummary": "The todo list React app with TypeScript and Jest has been created, but there are several issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. TypeScript compilation errors: Many of these are due to missing type declarations for React and testing libraries. We need to install the necessary @types packages.\n\n2. Jest tests are not running: The test command needs to be adjusted to find and run the test files.\n\n3. ESLint configuration issue: The ESLint config is using an outdated format and needs to be updated to the flat config system.\n\n4. npm audit couldn't run: We need to ensure npm is available or use an alternative for security auditing.\n\nTo resolve these issues, we should:\n1. Install missing @types packages\n2. Update the Jest configuration to find test files\n3. Update the ESLint configuration to use the flat config system\n4. Ensure npm is available for security auditing\n\nAfter making these changes, we should re-run the TypeScript compiler, Jest tests, and ESLint to verify that the issues have been resolved."
